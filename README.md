This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), providing a solid foundation for rapid development and deployment.

### Quick Commands

In the project directory, execute the following:

-   **`npm start`**: Initiates the app in development mode. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to view in the browser. Enjoy live reloads and lint error notifications for a smooth coding experience.
    
-   **`npm test`**: Engages the test runner in an interactive mode. For more details, see [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).
    
-   **`npm run build`**: Compiles the app for production into the `build` folder. It ensures optimal performance with minified builds and hashed filenames. Ready for deployment! Learn more about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).
    
-   **`npm run eject`**: This irreversible command removes the single build dependency, granting you full control over configurations. Note that all commands except `eject` will still operate, but they now target the copied scripts.
    

### Please Note

-   **Eject at Your Own Risk**: `eject` is a one-way street. Once done, it can't be undone. It's an advanced feature for those who need complete control over their build setup.
